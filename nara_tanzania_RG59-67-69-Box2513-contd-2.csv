Elsewhere at Parliament action on a number of bills was taken the first day and several have already been approved. However the measure to set up a National Livestock Commission received heavy going and consideration was postponed at the request of the Junior Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives. Parliamentarians indicated firmly that farmers did not like the high degree of Government centralization of marketing implied in the bill (memories of last years problems with marketing coops are strong) and asked that there be a farmers referendum on the measure. Also receiving some criticism is the Governments bill introducing the forms and procedures for compliance with the Arusha Declarations provisions forbidding two incomes or holding shares in private companies for national and local leaders. Parliamentarians complain that the bill relates only to M.P.s that it be broadened to include all TANU and Government officials.

He said also that he didnt really know how many Tanzanians had been detained but that his figure of 200 was an effort to smoke out the Government on the case.

Its not that there isnt the potential for disorder here viz. the 1964 Army Mutiny. However a combination of determined and energetic leadership on Nyereres part and a general Government policy of stopping trouble before it starts has thus far kept things calm and stable. example of this latter policy the Tanzanian Government refused to allow any demonstrations over the recent hangings in Rhodesia even though Tanzania is one of the most militant African countries of all on this question. Speechmaking and education continue to be the main means through which Nyerere and his Government exercise leadership. An example of the first was the Presidents tour of the South where he attended the TANU meetings at Mtwara and toured Mozambique border areas repeating his often-expressed themes of hard work and vigilance. He returned to Dar March 15. There were reports that a similar tour by First Vice President KARUME to Tanga last month had been less successful. supposedly shouted down by hostile students at a Tanga school. An example of the second leadership technique is the current seminar for TANU leaders on national policies at Dars University College. Ministers and other Government officials have addressed the sessions on such subjects as the East African Community hopes for Arusha-to-Mwanza transportation routes and international financial problems.

President said that Kambona was a thief Affeir and a prostitute The who would be jailed if he returned to Tanzania thus associating himself fully with Second Vice President KAWAWAs revelations about Kambonas finances. On January 11 in Parliament had again the next day at the Revolution Day rally Kawawa pointed out that Kambona had deposited $125000 in his bank accounts from June 1965 to December 1966 period during which he had received only $14350 in pay and allowances from his Government and TANU posts. With Hanga present at the Revolution Day rally under police guard Nyerere told the crowd that the ex-minister was incompetent and an idiot. He said that these faults were not grounds for detaining him but that he had been picked up only when he began spreading the story that the Zanzibar contingent of the Tanzanian Army had asked him to come back from his self-exile abroad. Nyerere also revealed that Guinean President TOURE had interceded with him for Hanga and that he had told Toure that he would release Hanga to a special Toure emissary who could then take him back home to Zanzibar. Since Hanga is in anything but the good graces of the Zanzibari regime this is hardly a generous offer. Meanwhile Kambona was busy in London returning the fire directed at him. He told a group of African students in London on January 14 that Tanzania had become a dictatorship and that the one-party system which he still favored had been perverted by Nyerere. He ducked the students questions about his finances and waffled on his challenge to Kawawa to repeat his accusations about his bank deposits without Parliamentary immunity (which Kawawa had done on January 12).

They will be watched even more closely in the The issue is not yet laid to rest and it is expected that future the Government will have something to say about Oscars attacks from London. In direct contrast President NYERERE made a short eloquent statement to the Diplomatic Corps on New Years Day. He emphasized his belief that there can be no peace as long as injustice is rife in the world.

Nyerere himself reacted to the controversy by ending his Revolution Day speech with a plea to forget the issue and get on with the implementation of the Arusha Declaration.

A student asked the President whether there was still freedom of speech in Tanzania. Nyerere said that there was but speakers were not allowed to break the law. Those trying to square Nyereres actions during the past week with his usual charm and humanitarianism can find an immediate contributing element in the fact that it is January -- a hot windy month in Dar which seems to put most people on edge. is the fact that Hangas attempt to involve the Army in his actions and Kambonas mention in London of the January 1964 Army mutiny touch a particularly raw Nyerere political nerve.

The threat of an intra-party election which might unseat Mondlane seems to have passed but his standing received a blow the weekend whose ultimate effects are still unclear. In an effort to expose and clear racially motivated dissidents out of the Mozambique Institute a FRELIMO-run school for refugees just outside Dar Mondlane issued an order concurred in by Second Vice President KAWAWA closing the school. order was countermanded however while the students were en route to rural camps where they would presumably be rehabilitated through sunshine and physical labor.

Kawawa returned March 27 and immediately overruled Sijaona thus reaffirming Mondlanes right to run his own party. Though Mondlane seems to have won this round the opposition to him while sparked among the students by an African Catholic priest named GUENJERE is based on several deeper factors. First is Mondlane himself. He is an urbane educated man who by background and training has little in common with the FRELIMO rank and file.

These transport problems probably figured as important items among the subjects discussed by Presidents Nyerere and Kaunda at Abercorn April 2 or 3 though there was some speculation that they might also have talked about Zambias air defense problems. Earlier in the week President Nyerere went to Nairobi to meet with the other two East African heads of state meeting as the East African Authority. The three Presidents appointed Tanzanias H. E.

There is some unpublicized doubt that the land was plowed early enough and whether wheat will grow in all sections of the tract. Other bearish news included a January 17 announcement by the Ministry of Agriculture that a pyrethrum glut meant that the price paid farmers would be cut more than two-thirds and the Wigglesworth Hard Fibers Reports news that 1967 was the worst year ever for sisal growers. News that John MALECELA Tanzanias Ambassador to the U.N. and anti-imperialist gadfly was going to be sent to Addis Ababa was a cheerful development. The Govern- ment made it clear through the columns of the Nationalist January 18 that it favored the Rwandan position in the current controversy between Kigali and Kinshasa over the disposition of the ex-mercenaries. The continued presence in Dar of Austin OKWU Biafran Representative to East and Central Africa and his ability to give press conferences and public speeches indicated that Tanzanias neutrality in the Nigerian conflict was still biased toward the secessionists. A less meaty foreign affairs development was the Governments fierce statement on January 13 that if British suppliers did not reduce their prices to reflect sterling devaluation Tanzania would take measures. There are indications that the Government has huffed and puffed without having any clear idea of what it should do if prices dont fall and it is plain that British suppliers would have gotten the message much more clearly if it had been transmitted in the form of a few cancelled orders. Despite the continuing strains over the devaluation question the new East African Community proceeded with plans to move its headquarters to Arusha by March 15. S. S.

Expanding on the theme that the attainment of human rights had to come before peace and that at some point both peace and human rights were closely interlinked the President made an earnest plea for justice before peace. He remarked that as long as peaceful routes to change remained those roads should be used. He could imagine circum- stances however in which all peaceful roads could be closed. He did not and could not advocate violence but he could see some cases where it is the only alternative and where international action is necessary. However he laid great stress on the fact that if this path is followed no state or group of states can make another group really free. emphasized that freedom can only come through the will of a them but they cannot make group of people to be tree their brothers truly Others can assist them and aid Such attempts merely replace one domination with another albeit more enlightened domination. While it was clear that what the President had to say accorded with the ideas he has often expressed about the war in Vietnam the speech was couched in general terms could have just as well been applicable to the problems of southern Africa about which the President is also deeply concerned. As if to confirm this the following day an editorial in the party paper Uhuru echoed the same theme.

Some talked of releasing the extensive material now in the Governments hands about Oscars financial position. This might prove embarrassing for some foreign governments as well as for the African Liberation Committee of the OAU. With Oscar breaking his silence in London there seems to be absolutely no hope that he can return to Tanzanian political life while Nyerere remains in control. It seems that those of his supporters who are not in jail will be even more closely watched than heretofore. The party Swahili language newspaper Uhuru wound up the week with a tough editorial claiming that they now know what Oscar meant when he said in London last August that there were groups of subversives in Tanzania. And Uhuru urged that the 12 million plus Tanzanians be on guard to root out those subversives who still remained. Oscars claims from London for human rights and individual liberty and for a trial for detainees contrasted sharply with his own statements when he sponsored and railroaded through the Preventive Detention Act in Parliament in 1962.

If you drive carefully have a four-wheel drive vehicle and have plenty of time the chances are good that you can get from Dar es Salaam to the Zambian border by Above and beyond this basis of fact however the TANU party papers have waged a campaign of denouncing imperialist anyone who says there is anything wrong with the road.

Most favored Tanzanias move but letters in the party press are hardly a valid indicator of public There is also a CAS report that the local secessionist representative . Austin Okwu was paying $14.00 for letters favorable to Biafra. A few courageous souls wrote to the Standard opposing the Governments action denouncing those hard to hear above the shouting in Uhuru who did not support Biafra. The Nationalist editorialized against President Tirinanas statements about encouraging secession and Uhuru ran a series of news articles actually thinly disguised editorials roasting the FMG and its British backers. The international reaction as pointed out in the Economist is much more interesting and much more significant than the trained-seal response of the TANU press. The Embassy still thinks that recognition of Biafra was not in Tanzanias interest though the point should be made that it all depends on what is meant by interest. In the Western sense of interest as meaning the increased security and prosperity of the state we stick by our assessment. But if Tanzania is looked upon as a country whose security appears to be threatened by no one (save perhaps the Portuguese) and whose prosperity is slight and when the dominant political figure is seen to be a believer in moral principle and nobility of purpose as legitimate the secessionists is in tanzanias an argument can be made that recognizing This argument an ethe south te to ne pot tune inter in piotra made despite the problems it raises and despite national unity considerations. At any rate Tanzania has not been generally condemned by the international community some sympathetic voices have been heard (including the Ivory Coast and Burundi though the Rurundi Foreign Minister April 24 in Dar that his Government would not recognize Biafra). If talks do come about between the FMG and the secessionists perhaps Tanzania can claim to have played a constructive role. The main actors in this three-sided drama are reacting in predictable ways. Nigeria is withdrawing the lawyers which it sent some time ago to help staff Tanzanias judicial system and the Tanzanian Ministry of Justice is rapidly shifting around the available Tanzanian magistrates to fill the resulting vacancies. Okwu has announced that a Biafran embassy would open soon be the anhose he as anand publicly cos to talking be would taking the Nigerian question before the U.N. and the AU to charge the FMG with mass massacre but there have been no official statements on this sore.

The Agency has asked the Embassy whether one or both of them might be sent to Dar es Salaam for approximately one year during which time they would be attached to the United States Information Service. They would be primarily engaged in the study of the Swahili language during their assignment in Tanzania though they would also participate in an on-the-job training program designed to prepare them for service as regularly assigned officers of the United States Information Service in East Africa. The Embassy would appreciate being informed whether the Ministry would be amenable to having one or both of officers assigned to Dar es Salaam either as a special non-quota increment to the American Diplomatic Mission or as members of a special training quota which might be set up for them.

Mgonjas statement was eloquently drafted (obviously in good part by President Nyerere and liberally larded with humanitarian justifications but it fell far short of convincing most independent observers. To begin with the immediate reaction of the Nigerian Federal Military Government -- to press even harder for the forceful suppression of the secession --undermined the basic practical aim that Nyerere seemed to be trying to achieve namely to bring about negotiations and an end to the fighting.

Lastly and this point proceeds from the first two few observers could see how recognition of Biafra serves Nyereres or Tanzanias interests.

Mr. Mbonde said that the Nationalist was not the Government. I said that I was aware of this but our note was an effort to find out just what the Nationalist was. If we could get some sort of answer to this either written or oral we would then be in a much better position to fulfill our responsibility to report on and accurately interpret events in Tanzania. Mr. Mbonde said he would discuss our note with his colleagues in the Foreign Office and be in touch with me in due course. 8∞%0 15 OR OCIT USE OR2Y 1/1/68 POL 2 TANZAN FOL; GBRoberts;h CONFIDENTIAL,,,www.archives.gov,Copyright of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and The Airqiv Document Explorer.

Previously; he had been given visas good for a year. The Tanzanian Embassy in Washington which had transmitted tate tart merican visa i a based on reciprocity. was informed by the Department of Accordingly the terms (validity period and number of entries allowed of an American visa issued to a national of a foreign country is the same as the terms of similar visas issued by that foreign country to American nationals. Since Tanzania currently issues visas to American officials good only for a single entry within three months Anerican law obliges us to issue the same sort of visa to Tanzanian officials. The Embassy is aware however that Tanzanian immigration authorities issue re-entry permits to American officials after they arrive in Tanzania good for periods varying from three months to one year. Accordingly if the Embassy could receive an official statement from the Ministry setting forth the terms of the re-entry permits which American officials can expect to receive after arriving in Tanzania the Embassy would be prepared to request the Department of State to consider a Tanzanian visa plus the subsequent re-entry permit as a single action to which the United States should reciprocate under its visa laws. the United States Government does not issue re-entry permits to non-immigrants but relies rather on multiple entry visas to achieve the same purpose the Embassy believes the Department of State may be amenable to a proposal from the Embassy that it interpret reciprocity in this manner. /5 -06 3 1/1/68 POL 2 3 Dn TANZAN Embassy of the United States of America Dar es Salaam April 16 1968.
