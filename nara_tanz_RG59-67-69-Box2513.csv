Retail price problems have resulted in the September 19 announcement of the formation of a National Price Control Advisory Board. The Board will be broadly representative but it is not clear how much teeth it will have. It is clearly aimed at what are known as 'unscrupulous traders.' Hopeful sounds have been heard from the plan to build a $28000000 plant to make paper from sisal but nothing has been signed as yet. Other unpopular people during the week included a Nigerian diplomat who hails from 'Biafra') who had to be expelled from his house because he did not want to be sent back to Lagos and the mentally ill Dar Magistrate's Dar Magistrates Victo Pissuing a han ag acquitted by the and of having illegally brought into Tanzania a concealed firearm.

A different sort of storm broke at a Coast Region TANU meeting September 20 when it was alleged some TANU employees had asked people to vote out their boss the Regional Chairman. The Coast Regional Commissioner defended the practice as no more than ordinary canvassing for votes. What may turn out to be a glimpse of the future came to light on September 21 when it was revealed that workers at the Chinese Communist-built Friendship Textile Mill in Dar es Salaam had supposedly agreed to work longer and redouble their efforts in order to increase productivity. No one knows if this will set a precedent for the Tan-Zam but the Embassy received a report during the week which indicates such tactics might be necessary if the rail link is to be realized. According the report improvement of the already partially existing Lake Tanganyika rail water and road route to Zambia would cost one-quarter as much and would be highly profitable after it was in Indications are that much MAO-thought will be needed before the same claims can be made too a tan-Zam railroad through Tanzania's Southern Highlands.

It also seems evident that Tanzania still retains a certain admiration for China is far Tanzanda and the chinese have conducted their relations wàth enough away from the Tanzanians probably more skillfully than they have with anyone else. When these facts are combined with Tanzania's politically-motivated desire to improve land links with Zambia the Chinese offer vague as it seems to be must have been hard to resist.

Trade talks were also being conducted overseas on coffee another ailing Tanzanian export Tanzania's basic export quota was raised to 600000 bags with the actual percentage exported of this amount depending on coffee price levels. The increase represents half of what Tanzania wanted but the lack of any unfavorable local response probably indicates it was the most anyone thought could be obtained. Good business news came from the Government-owned National Bank of Commerce since last February Tanzania's only commercial bank. During its first five months the NBC made a profit of $840000 according to the Chairman Amon J NSEKELA. Nsekela also announced in his address to a branch managers' meeting that as of October 1 all branches would be able to engage in foreign business that new branches would not be opened indiscriminantly that a public savings education campaign would be started that dead wood would be cut out of the bank staff and that all employees of the NBC should give the public good service.

If this accord represents a Tanzanian political swing toward Peking it is taking place under Fresident Nyerere's control since his position in Tanzania remains strong. Denunciations of ex-minister Oscar Kambona continue but Kambona himself was quiet. Issues abound for the forthcoming parliamentary and party meetings in Mwanza issues which can be used either to berate or praise the Government but there are no signs as yet of the coalescence of political groupings to exploit these issues. Second Vice President Kawawa went off on a visit to Scandinavia and a special Yugoslav envoy arrived to discuss the Middle East crisis with President Nyerere. **キネキ＊米本 率冬本发本米水米 On September 5 Communist China Tanzania and Zambia signed an agreement in Peking 'to construct the Tan-Zam Railway' according to the local press.

It is still entirely possible that the Chinese Communists will construct the line since their current relations with Tanzania are good notwithstanding what has been going on in the rest of the world. Chinese representation in Tanzania has been low-key and effective and President Nyerere's Government con- tinues to be impressed by China's national spirit and nation-building Nevertheless much is yet to be done before the first rail is laid and all that can be said with certainty at this point is seems as if yet another study will be done of the question of whether a railroad should be built connecting Zambia and East If the decision to have the Chinese do another railway study indicates a Tanzanian swing toward Peking the swing is taking place under the and control of President Nyerere. He continues to maintain his dominant political position in Tanzania and he spent much of the past week receiving delegations proclaiming their loyalty to him and his policies. In fact marching in support of the Arusha Declaration has become so widespread that the TANU Youth League has asked that all marching groups register their pilgrimages so that proper note might be taken of them. Even some of the students at the Dar es Salaam University College source of last year's anti-Government demonstration plan a march for next week. In receiving and addressing groups of marchers the President praised their loyalty and patriotism but he also took some swipes at ex-minister Oscar Kambona. He told a delegation of police people September 2 that there had been clear evidence of a plot by 'mad and foolish' people to cause trouble and divert Tanzanians from carrying out the Arusha Declaration. The day before he called Kambona a liar once more and in all his talks he emphasized the familiar national unity hard work opposition to 'exploitation' and self-reliance. If these statements by the President were not enough to scotch the rumors emanating from London of a reconciliation between Nyerere and Kambona front-page anti-Kambona editorial blasts in the September 1 TANU party papers left little to the imagination. Kambona was told to 'stop fooling the people.' The Mtwara annual TANU District Conference joined the outcry by passing a resolution calling for Kambona's expulsion from the party for having 'deceived' so many people.

Kambona's associates also stayed out of the limelight; former Minister of State for Union Affairs A. K. Hanga turned up unheralded in Conakry (despite last week's reports that his bookings from Cairo to Guinea had been cancelled) and former C.I.D. Director Akena's trial for embezzlement was adjourned again this time to September 15. As has been the case for some time President Nyerere continued to enjoy the support of his top officials and of Tanzania's various political organizations. Minister of Lands Settlement and Water Development Abdulrahman the cabinet's leading leftist light was on tour praising hard-working farmers the Arusha Declaration and thrift. He promised people in dry areas that the Government would do its best to see that they got water. Second Vice President Kawawa who flew off on an official visit to Scandinavia on September 3 told members of the Tanzanian Army before his departure that they should work to create a small politically sound military organization. TANU extended the Arusha purity rules to cover candidates for Regional TANU Chairmen as well as the previously covered Regional Members of the National Executive. Preparations are well under way for the forthcoming TANU and Parliament meetings next month in Mwanza and the TANU Youth League plans to hold its annual conference in Dar toward the end of this month. These meetings will have much to discuss both in public and in the corridors because even though President Nyerere's position is strong at the moment the political and economic landscape around him is littered with traps and pitfalls. Some recent intelligence reports indicate for instance that Nyerere was bitter and abusive with several leading politicians immediately before the Kambona affair broke and any personal resentments that may have been generated as result of such incidents could reinforce the resentment which already exists among many politicians over the more stringent provisions of the Arusha Declaration.

A railways inspector injured in a derailment two ago said on September 4 that construction of the link had been 'rushed.' Those in search of more important issues could find them in the state country's co-ops. Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives Bryceson had dissolve the committess of three cooperative unions committees of their 55 affiliated primary societies during the week for inefficiency and mismanagement. A hot and exploitable local issue boiled over in Dodoma on September 1 when the Regional Commissioner ordered price reductions on a series of basic retail commodities. Screams of protest could be heard even in Kenya where the Standard's correspondent reported people were calling the Commissioner's action 'blatant tyranny.' The Standard itself warned against Regional Commissioners becoming feudal despots acting outside of the law and the Dodoma shopkeepers planned to protest to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry through the Dar es Salaam Chamber of Commerce. On September 6 the Dodoma Regional Commissioner told the traders that if they didn't like what he had done they could either leave the country or get out of the retail business Actually if submitted to a popular poll the Commissioner's action would probably receive widespread support since Asian shopkeepers and their business practices are not loved but if his actions result in a serious disruption of local trade the average man may end up hurt and an alert politician may end up with an issue. Government defenders at the forthcoming meetings will not lack however for examples of Government moves designed to help the ordinary person. Reports from London indicate that an international sisal agreement may be about to be concluded and any action which will help to stop the downward slide in prices of one of Tanzania's most important export crops cannot help but benefit the country's Agriculture Minister Bryceson returned from London September 3 and announced the good news that Tanzania may be given a bigger coffee export quota. Visiting pundit Rene Dumont advised on September 7 however that the long-term salvation of Tanzania's agriculture lies in growing food not coffee cotton or sisal since overproduction and synthetics threaten these latter products while rising world population figures indicate a continued strong demand for foodstuffs.

Machinery for a $560000 cookie and candy factory arrived September 3 in Arusha. Nationalist introduced ideology into Tanzania's industrial progress when it editorialized on September 1 that the country's co-ops should be encouraged to open industries not individual entrepreneurs. The paper said nothing about the sad state of much of the co-op movement in this particular article. The Coast Region's Regional Commissioner took a similar line September 3 when he said that TANU branches should be established in all factories to act as among other things watchdogs against anti-Government activity and subversion. Pay raises for some workers were announced during the week. in Dar es Salaam and Tanga will get about 7% more retroactive to December 1 1966 while local government employees of the lowest grade are being given 15% to 20% increases. These actions will be popular with the workers concerned but they raise the problem often cited by President Nyerere of the growing gap between farmers and wage-earners' incomes. The Bank of Tanzania's report for the month of August indicates that banknotes in circulation went up $7420000 to $66080000 coins rose $280000 to $4200000 advances to banks almost doubled rising $4480000 to $10080000 advances to the Government totalled $1 120000 and Government deposits slid from $2268000 to $378000. Foreign exchange holdings held almost steady falling slightly from $54460 000 to $54180000. increased money circulating in the economy is due to the seasonal effects of the country's cotton pro-duction but it can be seen that the Tanzanian shilling still enjoys foreign exchange backing. Tanzania's exchequer accounts for FY 1967 published on September 1 indicate the country was in surplus on current account but badly in deficit on capital account. Those who will participate in the Mwanza meetings can thus find things to moan about and things to cheer about but which they select will probably depend on how Nyerere handles them and how they personally feel about recent developments in Tanzania. of any organized opposition or even There are still no signs semi-independent groups supporting the President but the issues are there if a political grouping ever gets the stimulus or opportunity to coalesce.

Pavicevic saw President Nyerere and left September 6 for Zambia saying that prolongation of the Middle East crisis would bring about a world conflict. The two British 15-year-old winners of a television contest also left September 6 but their comments were restricted to statements that Tanzania was 'fabulous.' The governors of East Africa's central banks met in Dar September 6 to discuss common problems and an eight-man U.A.R. trade delegation arrived the same day. in the week a six-man Japanese survey team arrived to study small industries and seek Japanese aid opportunities. NUTA Deputy General Secretary Tandau who was traveling in his capacity as an AATUF official returned September 4 from a trip to Hungary Czechoslovakia and Austria. Roy Rogers arrived in Arusha September 2 to hunt big Tanzania's leading V.I.P. export during the week was Second Vice President Kawawa whose visit to Denmark in the course of his tour of Scandinavia was expected to produce a state loan to Tanzania according to the Danish Foreign Office. Continued good relations with Israel on the technical plane at least were indicated by the September 3 departure of a girl from Moshi for training in Israel in adult education and literacy teaching. Overseas visits that won't or probably won't take place significant than those which did happen. Editorials and 'news' stories in the TANU party papers indicate that it is less and less likely that President Nyerere will attend the Kinshasa summit. The Nationalist noted that many African heads of state including U.A.R. President Nasser would not be going and Uhuru editorialized that the meeting should be postponed because security is bad in The Embassy was officially informed on September 5 that President Nyerere's trip to the U.S. to address the Foreign Policy Association had been cancelled because it was felt that 'such a visit at this juncture would not be opportune.' true that Nyerere has the Mwanza meetings to attend but the reference to the inopportunity of the time rather than 'other commitments' gives rise to thoughts that he may believe that Viet-Nam the railroad agreement with Peking or perhaps the building of socialism in Tanzania make it a poor idea to visit the United States at this particular time. The local freedom fighters issued communiques during the week with FRELIMO claiming 24 Portuguese KIA and 5 WIA during July together with one bridge destroyed while the MPLA said it had wiped out 198 Portuguese troops during June and July and had shot down three planes including a B27 and a DC4 bomber (sic).

A terse announcement made public on September 1 that 35 Makonde tribespeople had been picked up under the Preventive Detention Act indicated that not every African along the Tanzania-Mozambique border is on Mondlane's side. No reasons were given for the arrests but it seems likely that the people involved were working for the Portuguese • The Standard took an interesting tack on the liberation question in its September 5 editorial when it denounced the Soviets and the Chinese Communists for delaying the freedom struggle by bypassing the OAU*s African Liberation Committee and supporting splinter liberation groups which ought to be allowed to go out of existence. The Standard argued that if the Communists would stop their secret subsidies there would be greater unity and more effectiveness in the liberation movement. Comment on foreign issues in Tanzanian newspapers included North Vietnamese national day articles in the TANU party press. stories were merely congratulatory puffs probably handed out by the North Vietnamese Embassy and they were unusual only in that they contained no anti-American comment. James Baldwin was quoted in Ngurumo as opposing the U.S. role in Viet-Nam and Stokely Carmichael got good play in The Nationalist for his statements in Hanoi that he and his associates were not reformers but wanted to change the American regime. The Nationalist's 'Pressman' column took off on supposed U.S.-U.K. plans to construct military bases in the Indian Ocean. The Soviets were particularly busy with the newspapers. Their Embassy's Press Section sent a poorly-conceived letter to The Nationalist September 6 denouncing the letter writer who had denounced Russian activity in Africa last They got much space in Ngurumo the same day describing the visit of a Tanzanian parliamentary delegation to the U.S.S.R. and the next day they practically bought out Ngurume with stories of their letter to The Nationalist and of the parliamentarians Intimations of the growing influence of socialist morality in Tanzand were particularly strong during the week.

REF The slow public political demise of ex-minister Oscar Kambona continued to fascinate Tanzania-watchers but the process began to take on the appearance of a long-range badminton game as he in London and President Nyerere in Dar es Salaam batted charges and counter-charges back and forth at one The President was still getting the better of a more and more unequal contest. Some local elections attested to the vitality of Tanzania's unique one-party political system but the country was still plagued with problems in its co-ops and the sisal industry. Links with Zambia were strengthened with the announcement Zambia would remove import duties on goods of East African origin and with the news a high-level Tanzanian-Zambian ministerial team had arrived in Peking to discuss the Chinese railroad-building offer.' The West continued to fare poorly in the TANU party papers. 水冬水米* **ネネ¥ The decline and fall of Oscar Kambona and all his works showed signs of turning into a semi-permanent feature of the Tanzanian political scene. The play shifted back and forth between London and Dar es Salaam with President Nyerere making the week's opening move in an impromptu August 25 before a delegation of Kambona's constituents who had come to the capital to denounce him publicly. The President told the delegation that Kambona had 'cheated' TANU Tanzania and Africa. He could not be legally sacked President said that in view of from Parliament as the delegation had requested but the should return home all the charges and counter-charges he resign explain himself and run for re-election to Parliament.

He said he would outline these conditions in a press conference he would call on August 31 at which time he would also 'lift the lid off politics in Tanzania.' The newspaperman to whom Kambona gave this information speculated that Kambona would couple his return with an insistence that Parliament be dissolved President Nyerere resign and everyone run for re-election. As things have turned out we still do not know what Kambona has in On August 30 he postponed his press conference until 'next week.' He still insisted nevertheless that he planned to return to Tanzania and resume his political career but the timing would depend on his doctor's advice. Meanwhile the steady denigration of Kambona continued within Tanzania. Ngurumo attacked him editorially August 28 and three days later the TANU party papers roasted him in front page editorials. The Nationalist accused him of trying to 'fool the people.' The revelation that a Dar es Salaam real estate agent was trying to rent his residence on a long-term lease to two embassies did additional damage to Kambona's image since it showed that either he had no intention of returning to Tanzania or if he was going to come back he had no intention of abiding by the Arusha Declaration's rules against politicians having houses to rent. Kambona's brother Otini denied the story on August 30 claiming that he alone was in charge of Kambona's house and he had no instructions to rent it nor had any foreign diplomats looked at it. In making this statement Otini was in effect calling the real estate agent a liar since the latter had approached the American Embassy saying he had a letter from Oscar Kambona giving him an exclusive on the house. was also calling the Ghanaian Charge a liar since he had told the Standard that he had inspected the house but had decided not to rent it. Whatever the truth of the matter is the uproar did not do the Kambonas any good. While all this was going on Kambona's associates were not faring much better.

Prospects are that efforts to remove all vestiges of Kambona and his influence will continue. Kambona's finances according to CAS reports are under investigation to see if an extraditable criminal case can be developed. Former C. I. D. Director Akena a Kambona associate is still under a criminal indictment with the case due to come to court on September 1. Dar buzzes with anti-Kambona gossip and though there are those who think that Second Vice President Kawawa has been a winner as a result of the Kambona affair it seems as if President Nyerere is still the biggest winner of all. As usual Myerere continued to be active in consolidating his strong political position. He took no trips but he received what seemed to be steady stream of visitors coming to pledge their support for him and his policies. He told them he appreciated their backing but he also did not fail to repeat his often-heard strictures on need for hard work. He said that in some villages the people were so relaxed it was like a holiday every day. The Cabinet's leading leftist ideologue Abdulrahman Babu was touring the country inspecting irrigation schemes and redevelopment projects and the Government received the support of a leading Muslim figure in the August 25 Standard in the form of an article pointing out that the Arusha Declaration was in full accord with Mohammedan economic principles. These principles as described in the Standard had a medieval anti-usury tone. The persistent vitality of Tanzania's one-party political system was particularly evident during the week. Plans were being formed to have the next session of Parliament meet in Mwanza rather than the capital since some important TANU meetings involving most M.P.'s were to be held in that Lake Victoria town in October but there were a few snags as to the exact dates. Close-fought local elections in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya brought home the fact that incumbency was no guarantee of political longevity. These elections were also notable for the strict way in which the Arusha anti-capitalist anti-conflict of interest rules were being enforced. Several prospective candidates for the Mbeya Urban District Council were ruled out for 'capitalist tendencies.' In both cases however the winners were long-time TANU stalwarts. Internal Tanzanian developments were not without problems however.

Another form of takeover took place in Tanga where the local club was closed up because it would not heed Government warnings to adopt a non-racial policy. In an ostensibly business move which also had racial overtones the Dodoma Regional Commissioner closed up a group of Asian-owned shops whose proprietors had failed to attend a retail price-fixing meeting called by the Regional authorities. Complaints were aired in Dar and Mbeya that the Tanzanian Women's Union (UWT) needed revitalization and the National Union of Tanganyika Workers (NUTA) issued public blasts against employers whose attitude caused unrest. Government's tax collection procedures received some unfavorable publicity on August 30 when reports appeared of over-zealous publicans who had beat up delinquent taxpayers in Newala rubbed pepper in their hair and made them dance till they dropped from exhaustion. The officials are being prosecuted for assault and abuse of authority. The week's main economic events concerned the developing links between Tanzania and Zambia. On August 25 it was announced in Lusaka that the Zambian Government had sent a letter to the Tanzanian Government removing as of November 1 all Zambian duties on imports of East African origin. Trade with Zambia should also be facilitated by the 36 Canadian heavy tank trucks which arrived at Tanga August Tanzanian Finance Minister Jamal and Zambian Minister of State for Finance Soko arrived in Peking August 30 by way of Pakistan to discuss and presumably try to clarify the Chinese 'offer' to build the Tan-Zam Railroad. A different aspect of the developing links with Zambia got good play in the August 29 Uhuru and The Nationalist. The 'Hell Run's™ only girl truck driver got her picture on both papers front pages but The Nationalist unchivalrously noted she had wrecked two trucks in the eleven months she has been driving to Zambia. Progress in the negotiations over the compensation to be paid the nationalized foreign firms was made public on August 28 when it was disclosed that approximately $10000000 was going to be paid to the former owners of five of the seven nationalized manufacturing firms.

The Government's probable headaches should it actually go through with its plans to take over most of the sisal industry were underlined August 31 when it was disclosed that drought and low prices were going to force 40 sisal estates to close their factories. The Tanga area will be the least hard hit with only five estates shutting down. Problems with another Tanzanian export commodity were publicized when it was announced in London that Tanzania had told the International Coffee Organization that it would withdraw unless its quota was raised. The Tanzanian representative complained that Tanzania had the lowest ratio quota to actual production of any country. Tanzanian pleas may go unheard though as all countries are currently clamoring for a larger slice of the coffee quota pie. There were two developments however which indicated that something was being done to break the grip declining commodity markets seem to have on Tanzania's economy. The National Small Industries Corporation announced that it had a scheme proposed by an Indian foreign expert which would help small upcountry industrial entrepreneurs to buy factory machinery on long-term credit and the Minister for Information and Tourism Hasnu Makame urged tourist operators in Arusha to open offices in Dar and promote the tourist business in and around the capital. Makame was also the subject of the week's top foreign affairs development when it was announced that he would head Tanzania's delegation to the forthcoming Kinshasa OAU Foreign Minister's meeting. used to be Minister of State for Foreign Affairs but the current incumbent C. Y. Mgonja is unavailable while he does his National Reports persist that President Nyerere will attend the Kinshasa summit but there has as yet been no official confirmation. Other prominent travellers will include Second Vice President Kawawa who plans to leave for Scandinavia September 3 returning September 17 and a five-man parliamentary delegation headed by Speaker Chief Adam Sapi which arrived in Moscow August 30. Efforts to arrange Tanzanian participation in a parliamentary trip to the U.S. fell through during the week when the Embassy was informed that none of its nominees would be available. Six Tanzanian library trainees left for the U. K. on August 27 and the Indian Navy's training ship 'Tir finished its goodwill visit on August 25 and left for Madagascar.

Tanzania's resident independence movements were quiet except for FRELIMO which claimed it had shot down three Portuguese planes at Mueda August 2 and had killed or wounded 100 Portuguese soldiers in the course of eight attacks between July 12 and August 8. Tanzanian Government banned the South West African National Union (SWANU) from operating in Tanzania on August 29 because it was ineffective and was not recognized by the OAU's African Liberation SWANU was never very active in Tanzania anyway and as far as the Embassy knows it mostly restricted itself to maintain-an office in Stockholm. The Nationalist and Uhuru editorialized August 25 for unity in the Rhodesian freedom movement and urged that the fight be carried on inside Rhodesia. The latter comment is of course a veiled slap at the freedom fighters' habit of spending much of their time drinking and politicking in Dar es Salaam. Foreign aid publicity was small-scale during the week. The wife of the East German Consul General was reported as presenting the Dar es Salaam UNT chapter with two bicycles children's clothes from the East German women's organization. The American Embassy got page- three play in the Standard presenting eight braille watches to the Government's Welfare Division. The U.S. also received credit in a small news story for the 35000000 pounds of food it had contributed to Tanzania through the Catholic Relief Services. and the TANU party papers did not hesitate to give space to more vitriolic comment. Ngurumo ran some more canned North Korean anti- American swill on August 25 and four days later published an Arab handout outlining Israeli plans to conquer the entire Middle East. The Nationalist editorialized on August 29 that more bombs and a 'phony' election in South Viet-Nam would be useless against the 'invincibility of the spirit of national rebellion against foreign occupation.' The Nationalist's 'Pressman' outdid himself in a column August 25 claiming that the 'imperialists' have invented the story of a Chinese civil war in order to cover up their many defeats all over the world. A somewhat different view appeared in the August 27 Sunday News (Standard) which let a strong anti-Chinese tone slip through in its weekly letter from Kenya. So far the Tanzanian press has been quite discreet in its handling of the Kenya-ChiCom troubles and has had nothing at all to say editorially.

Tanzanian interest in the ChiCom offer to build the Tan-Zam Railroad could indicate a rise in Peking's influence but there are other factors working against such a development. it seems clear that President Nyerere will be making the decisions.

African unity was still a dominant theme of local foreign policy developments. ***水***水米＊ *水本水水水本水米米米 Apparent connections between a number of seemingly disparate events during the week has produced the impression that Tanzania may well be entering a fluid period in its relationships with the outside world. Certain hitherto relatively constant assumptions and alignments seem to be ander reexamination but it is not yet clear what the new arrangement if any will be. The lingering eféects of the Kambona affair are playing an important role in producing this impression of more flexibility. President Nyerere tell us that he was deeply shaken and disillusioned by the final realization of Kambona's disloyalty.

A 1000-person rally attended the presentation of the petition to Morogoro Regional Commissioner Kapilima August 22. FurtherNyerere is turning cold eye on all those placed in the Government of Kambona. Prominent among this group is Ambassador to the UN Malacela whose position was none too stable already because of prominent enemies in the Foreign Office (Lukumbuzya Mulokozi et al) and because of the poor image of Tanzania he has been projecting by his continual intemperate outbursts. have been no rpt no positive predictions of his imminent withdrawal from the UN but his stock is low. The only hitch in the steady process of eliminating vestiges of Kambona's position was the postponement of the criminal trial of his associate ex-C.I.D. Director E. E. Akena to September 1. At the same time as these internal events were taking place the TANU party press came out with an unprecedented attack on the Soviet The ostensible cause for the attack was the disclosure that the Soviets were supplying arms to the Nigerian Federal Military Government. The Nationalist denounced the Russian action as interference in an internal African affair and although the paper could not refrain from cracks about reports the U. S. was also favoring one side or the other in Nigeria Russian policy was contrasted unfavorably with recent U.S. actions in the Congo. The Nationalist portrayed the Congo situation as one calling for prompt assistance to the central government while the Nigerian problem was described as much less clear with justice fairly evenly apportioned among the contestants. The paper pointed out that Russia did nothing in the Congo while the U. S. supplied Kinshasa with aircraft but Russia had been only too quick to intervene in Nigeria. This editorial was followed up on August 23 with a 'letter to the editor™ in The Nationalist vehemently denouncing the Soviets not only for their Nigerian policy but also for their actions all over Africa during the past few years. The Russians were accused of being imperialists and not socialists their aid personnel were blamed for 'living big' and the letter writer said they should be kicked out of Africa and out of the socialist camp. Since letters to the editor in The Nationalist are rarely bona fide private efforts the appearance of this attack on the Soviets and particularly its broad-guage nature raises interestingquestions. it is generally known that Kambona was accepting subsidies from the Soviets and since CAS has received reports that the Soviet Embassy CONFIDENTIAL,Kapilima; Nyerere; Malacela,Nigeria; Russia; Nigeria; Russia; Congo; Congo; Nigeria; Russia; Congo; Russia; Nigeria; Nigeria; Russia,,,

If a rethinking of Tanzanian relations with the Soviet Union is there are as yet no clear indications of what sort of relationships will take their place. An argument can be made that Chinese Communist influence is on the rise. The Chinese can be expected to look with favor on a Third World country which denounces the Russians and Tanzania currently seams to be looking with favor on Chinese offers to build the Tan-Zam Reilroad. Finance Minister Jamal left Dar es Salaam August 20 for an African Development Bank meeting in Abidjan from where he will go together with Zambian Finance Minister Wina to Peking to discuss the Chinese offer. article in the August 24 Standard which the Embassy knows to be based on briefings provided by officials in the Ministry of Finance said that 'There are clear indications that if the Chinese come up with the right answers following their offer to finance the rail link to the extent of £100000000 and construct it then the prestigious job will be theirs.' The Standard's article goes on to point out however that the Chinese offer like most Chinese aid projects is extremely nebulous and the Jamal-Wina mission may have a difficult time getting clear answers to their many questions. Ranged against the thesis that Chinese influence is growing are considerations which are outside Embassy Dar es Salaam*s province but which still should be mentioned. The current difficulties between Peking and Kenya may have an effect on Sino-Tanzanian relations given the current strong emphasis on East African unity and the likelihood that China might 'descend into chaos' as reported in Hong Kong's 1957 serve to work against an increase in Peking's ability to influence President Nyerere's Government. In addition some weight can be given fact that the Chinese Ambassador has been absent from Dar es Salaam for four months and the Chinese Embassy staff has been greatly reduced. Whichever way things go in Tanzania it is certain that Nyerere will be making the decisions. He and his chief lieutenants continued to tour the country and speak with one voice in support of the President's policies of socialism and self-reliance. Speaking at Kibaha on August said that he wanted to do away with exploitation and masters servants in Tanzania. He said that there would be no iron curtain against foreign ideas around the country but warned that people would not be allowed to preach against basic national doctrines. in Tabora the President prised the Tanzanian Army as an On August 24 instrument CONFIDENTIAL,Nyerere; Jamal; Jamal; Nyerere; Nyerere,Soviet Union; Russia; Zambia; Kenya; China,,,

The previous day the President had again denounced the master-servant mentality and had said that he and his associates would continue to support and explain the Arusha Declaration. First Vice President Karume provided a case in point of Nyerere's claim that all Tanzanian leaders would speak out for his policies. The Zanzibari leader praised the Arusha Dedlaration before Army officers in Tabora August 21 and denounced exploiters. He said that the Government hoped to build a nation in which there would be no very rich people but everyone would be self-sufficient. Second Vice President Kawawa warned Dar es Salaam businessmen August 19 that they must adopt more national-minded habits and then spent much of the rest of the week touring National Service camps exhorting youth to comply with the country's policies. A Roman Catholic students' seminar at the Dar University College endorsed the Declaration August 22 and a priest who had taken part in the seminar prepared an article which appeared in the August 23 Standard pointing out that Tanzania's mationalizations were in accord with Christian Tanzania's youth continued to take long walks as a sign of their support for the Government. TANU mainland Tanzania's single political party also acted to align itself more closely with current doctrines. New changes in the procedure for electing the 17 regional members of the party's National Executive and for choosing the Dar es Salaam TANU District Chairman call for every candidate to submit a declaration saying that he abides by the principles and rules of the Arusha Declaration. Each candidate must have 25 seconders and members Local TANU bodies will be able to cast preference votes for the people they favor but the actual elections will take place within the TANU National Conference. Taken together then the week's major political events form a picture of flexibility and possible change in Tanzania's international relationships. Furthermore that President Nyerere will be calling the shots. if there are to be changes it seems clear The Government's control over the country's economy did not seem as surehanded during the past week. A strong statement that no action would be tolerated which would interfere with national progress served to quell a strike threat by Tanzania's dockworkers. Nevertheless an announcement by the Dar es Salaam dockers' Workers' Committee Chairman that he would resign if rumors continued that he had been bribed indicated that the dockworkess were still angry and felt that their union and the Government had sold them out.

Second Vice President Kawawa's advice to Dar businessmen to police themselves or face price control and his warnings that they should promote local products can be read as signs that consumers and local manufacturers are also feeling a pinch. In answering Kawawa the out- going and incoming Presidents of the Dar Chamber of Commerce both called for closer cooperation between the Government and business and called for Government policies designed to clear away some local commercial problems. The Standard's editorial columns joined the Chamber however in speaking out against full price control though there was general agreement that Tanzania's price levels needed investiga- Reports continued to circulate that the compensation agreements for most of the nationalized industries were complete except for final signatures. The Government is also reported as having decided just how it will take over the sisal industry but it seems as if all that will be taken over is red ink. Agriculture Ministry Bryceson assured sisal planters in Tanga August 17 that the Government wanted to rescue the industry and not harm it but from all indications the producers want more done for them than speechmaking and nationalization. The most frequently heard proposal is exemption from the Government's Development Levy. set out for London on August 24 to attend an international coffee meeting and hopefully to do something for another basic Tanzanian export commodity which must deal with a declining world market. An internal marketing move was made public on August 17 when it was disclosed that the National Wheat Board would be dissolved and the National Agricultural Products Board would take over the selling of wheat. A train wreck on the Ruvu-Mnyusi Link line between Tanzania's Central Line and the Tanga Line renewed local doubts as to the quality of the link line's construction. East African Railways and Harbors is planning to conduct a full-scale inquiry into the causes of the accident.

President Kaunda announced that plans had been made for a complete transportation telecommunication and information link between Tanzania and Uganda. Kenyan Vice President Moi who was also in Zambia with Presidents Nyerere Obote and Kaunda later said that he had not taken part in the talks about the links and that EACSO would have to be consulted on such matters. The plans may not be as definite as Kaunda implied however since he gave no details at all. Another small fly in the East African unity ointment came to light on August 23 when Tanzania's Minister for Information and Tourism Hasnu Makame 'disappointment' that the organizers of the East African Safari Motor Rally had decided that next year's competition would begin and Nairobi as usual and not Dar. The issue may seem small but it is one more indication of the persistent resentment in Tanzania against Nairobis preeminence in East Africa.

Three Tanzanian co-op inspectors returned from studying credit unions in the U.S. and the Communist Chinese Saba-Saba exhibit opened on August 18 on Zanzibar. An official regue sto the Peace Corps for secondary school science teachers was further evidence of the gradual emergence of the Peace Corps from the cloud of suspicion cast on it by elements hostile to the U.S. at the time of the CIA-NAS difficulties several months ago.

Given the fact that there are still currency controls on movements of large sums of money outside of tast Africa it seems unlikely that he would have been allowed to take out such an amount had there not been at least some tacit official concurrence.

Such was the inauspicious beginning of a trip which took me my wife and our three children from Dar es Salaam by train from Kigoma to Mpulung by Lake Tanganyika steamer and from Mpulungu to Mbeya by Land Rover. At Mbeya my family left me and flew back to Dar while I continued home by road. It was a relaxing but interesting trip and I returned knowing more than I did when I left. The 44-hour train ride from Dar es Salaam on the Indian Ocean to Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika passes through some of the most miserable countryside I have ever seen. The train is comfortable--it proceeds at a more or less constant 20 miles an hour over meter-guage track for some 700 miles--and the food is not bad but the view out the window is one of semi- arid dusty and usually deserted bushland. In building the Central Line to the Lake the Germans were following the Arab trade and slaving route but they also passed straight through the hole in modern Tanzania's economic doughnut. As a result the Central Line consistently loses losses which are made up by the rest of the East African Railways' lines in Kenya Uganda and Tanzania.

If arrangements could be made to carry copper ingots on the barge on the return trip north profits would be even larger even though the Captain claimed the Lake-rail route to Dar would still be far cheaper than the truck route along the Great North Road. He implied however that too many people were making too much money out of the trucks to divert Zambian copper to the economical Liemba and its empty barge. The Liemba's economics are unrealized in more ways one. The Chief Engineer a taciturn Scot from Edinburgh told me that the Railways don't even care how much fuel he burns--the ship has no forced-draft stack smokes copiously continually sooting up its boiler tubes but as long the Liemba keeps moving Nairobi would rather not be bothered with fuel consumption reports.

After conditioning the tobacco is pressed into 220-pound bales and shipped off to be made into cigarettes. Depending on the grade given a bale of tobacco as it arrives at the factory the grower gets between 15€ and 50k a pound. Grading is a highly skilled occupation which requires long experience and intimate knowledge of what makes good or bad tobacco.

The master-cutter rough diamonds do not come directly from the Tanzanian Williamson Diamond Mine at Mwadui. All Mwadui's production is sent first to London where it is stored and only released in strict accordance with world demand presumably so the international diamond cartel can keep the price up. London released diamonds go to Antwerp and then back to but I was not told of any procedure to make sure Tanzania diamonds being cut at Iringa are Tanzanian diamonds that the and not Sierra Leonean or even South Africa. Diamond cutting is actually diamond grinding so I discovered. The rough diamond crystals are split halves cemented onto the metal tips of large wooden handles which are then held by the cutters against flat horizontal grinding wheels set like spinning plates down the center of a long work table. The wheels are coated with abrasive made from diamond dust. cutters share a wheel and sit on opposite sides of the table. The bottoms of the diamonds are shaped first and then the tops. 'Girdling' or cutting the minute facets around the outer edge of a diamond cannot be done yet at Iringa and the diamonds have to be sent elsewhere to be finished. The cutters are all young African men who seemed to be in their late teens. Mr. Verheyen-Hannes told me that they come from all over the country to ask to be taken on as trainee cutters. Before a boy is selected he is given a simple test to see if he is aware of such concepts as equality and symmetry. He is asked to divide a square drawn on a sheet of paper into four equal parts and he is given some bilaterally symmetrical solid shapes and asked to say where he would cut them to get two similar but mirror-image halves.

Morogoro The countryside around Morogoro was by far the richest and lushest I saw during the trip. cotton grow alongside the road while back in damo areas rice grows. I remarked on the area's prosperous look to the Morogoro Area Commissioner and the Regional Agricultural Officer whom I met in the Area Commissioner's office and who took me on a tour of the surrounding farmland. Morogoro owes its good fortune they told me to adequate rainfall and rich soil the latter washed down over the centuries from the Uluguru mountains which loom up over the town to heights of 7000 feet. Many years the Waluguru people who still live around Morogoro lived up ago in the mountains as a defensive measure and scratched a meager living from the eroded soil. Some coffee is still grown on the mountainsides but most people have moved down onto the flat land at the foot of the hills where the soil is better and slavers no longer raid. During our tour of farms near Morogoro we visited rice sorghum and sunflower fields. The Area Commissioner owned a two-acre rice plot we visited which he said he was allowed to keep under the Arusha Declaration because it was small enough for him to farm himself after office hours. If it had been so big as to require hired help he would have had to give it up or his official position up since he would then have been an 'exploiter.'

Tot No. 1 Page A-22 Conclusion So many observers of the Tanzanian scene have commented on the differences between what goes on in Dar es Salaam and what matters upcountry that it has become a cliché to note that Dar is not 'the real Tanzania' and that one must get out of the capital to find out what is really going on. People like Mdoe and the comments they make re-emphasize the truth the cliche. Mdoe the Mbeya town clerk the Iringa tobacco and the Captain of the Liemba never once mentioned socialism or self-reliance to me. Nor did they ever mention Tanzanian policy on the Middle East. This is not remarkable or unusual--people in American rural areas do not spend all their time worrying about Viet-Nam or the Great Society--but I was struck by the wide discontinuity between the high-sounding orinciples and concepts discussed in Dar and the practical problems facing Government officials and businessmen upcountry. impressed by many of the people I met but I was also impressed by the feeling that what seems to occupy the thovented uppet level in at es Salaam-socialism non alignment and the rights of Arab refugees--seems little applicability to the real problems facing Tanzania and may not be of much use in solving those problems. It even seemed to me that much of what occupies Dar is not only inapplicable to the country's real problems but may also have a negative effect on efforts to solve them. I was also struck by the fact that so many of the practical problems facing Tanzania seem to be based on one overall difficulty--the lack of adequate human resources. The inability of the Kigoma coffee co-ops to market the local the bankruptcy of the Ufipa District Council the over-staffing of local government the wide variation in grades of tobacco arriving at Iringa and the relaxed attitude of the people of Morogoro are They are problems skills cultural attitudes and education not problems Tanzana tas i t5 Share of poor soil or lack of transportation. physical problems but in no case do they seem to be what is really holding the country back. problem is not with the people who live in it. country but rather with the President NYERERE seems well aware of this fact when he lectures his people on the need for hard work and points out CONFIDENTIAL lile tere ts to d the he and his the Anounced go into up pers 原米米冰 in * past we North Youth that lined the a clash with FOR DEPT.

No. 1 Page 21 that there is plenty of land available in Tanzania. Yet I cannot help thinking that many of the Tanzanian Government's current policies seem designed to do away with or minimize the incentives needed to get people to work hard and develop the country. I realize that Tanzania's Leadership wants to avoid the social and political strains that result from wide economic disparities and even though I heard plenty of reports of discontent among the ordinary rural people I think the chances are that Tanzania will continue despite what the Matist tay it the the foresee and futuree bourgeois who make revolutions and the Arusha Declaration has done much to slow the emergence of an African bourgeoisie and place those who were about to emerge on the defensive. But what I saw and heard during our two weeks trip as well as what I have seen and heard in Dar es Salaam leads me to think that this stability will be achieved at the price of slower economic development. One French diplomat with whom I spoke a week after returning to Dar said that he believed Tanzania's future would state of permanent underdevelopment. I think this is a bit severe. Even with declining prices for its main exports there are the special economic circumstances visible our trio which result from Rhodesian UDI--the Great North Road transportation route and the demand for Tanzanian tobacco for instance--which are giving the Tanzanian economy an unexpected lift. Still the lack of human resources and the quest for political stability will put a crimp in the country's economic development though it can be argued that in the long run a slow steady and stable development might have better results than some other countries' boom-and-bust politically volatile pattern. re to the and bunced into ast North suth nat about police ed the ash with CONFIDENTIAL USE ONLY Drafted by; Clearances：,,Rhodesia,,,

No official announcement was made until two later after Anangisye had been seen at the police station and reporters from the Standard began asking questions. The Home Ministry finally confirmed that he had been picked but under the terms of the Act no reasons for his arrest had to be given and no court appearance would take place. In answer to a reporter's question the Ministry's spokesman said that no other M.P.'s were being held. Despite the role of the in bringing Anangisye's arrest to public attention it is interesting to note that not a word of the affair has appeared in the TANU party papers. Reliable reports have it that Anangisye was arrested soon after President Nyerere addressed a meeting of political leaders at State House July 15 and told them that he knew that many of them opposed his policies. Last week's publication of politicians' questions about the Arusha Declaration has made this obvious to the general public as well. The President reportedly warned his listeners that opposition to the Declaration would not be tolerated. Immediately after the Anangisye is said to have gone to Lugalo (totterly Colito) Barracks outside of Dar es Salaam and began agitating against the Government and the Declaration. He was immediately arrested. Anangisye's actions seem so stupid that there are those who think the whole affair was a trap laid by the Government. According to this theory President Nyerere knew of the moves being made and planned by his opponents. He thus called the meeting July 15 so that should they proceed with their activities they would have no reason to say they had not been Still Anangisye's semi-public political agitation at a Government installation right after such a meeting shows what might charitably be called the same lack of prudence which marked much of his career as TYL Secretary-General.

In his Saba-Saba Day speech July 7 President Nyerere complained that Africa had no dignity and urged the people not to follow their leaders blindly since leaders could be bought. Nyerere's address was rambling and off-the-cuff boosting the usual themes of hard work and socialism while condenming the now standard villains of capitalism and 'exploitation.' Second Vice President Kawawa covered much the same ground in his Saba-Saba speech but First Vice President Karume over from Zansibar for the afternoon took the line that everything the Government did was good even the pulling down of squatters! shacks and the rounding up of water-sellers. speeches were the climax of an uneventful and unenthusiastic week-long Saba-Saba celebration.

The question-answering booklet's fore- pointed out regretfully that none of the questions received were on socialism and self-reliance the Declaration's two main positive Instead they were exclusively on the provisions banning politicians from having outside business interests. Nyerere took a hard line in answering the questions and made it plain th t political learers would have to sell their rental property (even at a loss) and give up 'exploitation or else get out of politics. He said no capitalist would be elected to leadership. This theme was re-emphasized to the TANU cell leaders when the President told them the Government was planning to pass legislation in September sacking all leaders who do not conform to the Declaration including himself if necessary.

The Ministry for Home Affairs got its appropriation at the beginning of the week but in the process had to defend itself against complaints about police behavior administrative delays in granting naturalizations and extra-legal roundups of alleged cattle thieves. Chief Fundakira took the lead in pressing the Home Minister on this last point.

On July 7 the appointment was announced of Charles Ley to be the first Tanzanian General Manager of the National Tourist Board. The week's/economic development was also the top foreign relations story. The Finance and Transportation Ministers of Zambia and Tanzania met in Dar es Salaam July 9 and 10 to discuss the proposed Tan-Zam Railroad. A decision to establish a joint TANZANIA- ZAMBIA planning company emerged from the meeting whose chairman will be Zambian and whose headquarters will be in Dar. The company will examine such technical questions as the rail line's guage and will look into all offers of aid in building the line. Considerable confusion still exists as to exactly who has offered to do what in connection with this project. The source of much of the confusion Zambia's President Kaunda passed through Dar July 9 on his way home from the Nairobi East African Summit on the Nigerian problem.

The July Il Standard headlined the U.S. sending of 6-130ts to the Congo while the other either did not mention the event or buried it on back pages. The Standard ran a story July 7 attributed to Tanzanian 'Government circles' expressing doubt that Tanzanian troops would be sent to the Congo even if requested. A 'police' type request might be honored Several letters appeared in the Standard opposing Tanzania's pro-Arab stand and the TANU papers ran news of a North Korean trade show next week. One very reliable informant has told the Embassy that no one in the Tanzanian Government knows who authorized the exhibit or how the Koreans obtained permission to use a building owned by the Government's 'ational Bank of Commerce. Nevertheless it was announced July 13 that Commerce and Industry Minister Maalim would officially open the show. The Bank of Tanzania's report for June indicated that the onset of the cotton season had brought the usual increase in curreney in circulation and the usual decrease in Government and commercial bank deposits with the Bank. Tanzania's holdings of foreign securities suffered a seasonal drop from $59.92 to 858.94 million. Sales of this year's cotton crop contimed but the price continued to fall.

He acknowledged Israel's right to exist though its establishment was an act of aggression against the Arabs and Tanzania never thinks aggression is excusable. However Tanzania had made an exception in the case of Israel because Europeans and Christians had been so inhuman to the Jews. But Tanzania did not make an exception for the aggression of 1956 and the 'recent aggression.' decried the irony of Israel putting the crimes of anti-semitism on the shoulders of the Muslims and Arabs who were always nicer to the Jews than Europeans and Christians. Having thus negotiated the bogs and swamps of Middle East politics Makame emerged onto the firm ground of African affairs. He condemned Ghana the Ivory Coast for capturing Guinean diplomats expressed concern over Nigeria and denounced all betrayers of African freedom. In keeping with this last he refused any meeting with the South African Government point Tanzania's principles are not for sale. Tanzania also saw no reason to talk to the Portuguese and it supported FRELIMO together with the other liberation movements. Tanzania believed that the people of occupied territories their own fighting should unite for greater strength.

Tanzanian relations with Malawi were thoroughly aired. read out the text of an exchange of letters between the Tanzanian and Malawian Foreign Ministries last January in which Tanzania had said it only recognizes a boundary between countries running through the center of Lake Nyasa. Malawi had replied it would consider the question. Several Members of Parliament commented that Malawians were not such bad people but they suffered from bad leadership. Question time produced statements by Makame that Tanzania hoped TSHOMBE would get what he deserved that Tanzania would helo those anti-colonial refugee organizations who help themselves and that the Foreign Ministry did not waste money. One member said the Government should keep an eye on the Rhodesians who work at the Mwadui diamond mine and tell Tanzanians that life in Rhodesia is The debate closed with the Foreign Ministry being voted the money it had requested.

Al though the Home Ministry got its budget requests it seems doubtful that the last has been heard of this issue. The debate on the Ministry of Education's budget also followed a realist vs. idealist pattern. Education Minister ELIUFOO tried to take a middle position by plumping for Swahili but pointing out that study of English would now begin in the first grade instead of the third by speaking for the inculcation of 'socialist values' but denouncing the extremist recommendations of a recent TANU study group on education and by supporting Africanization of teaching positions but emphasizing that good expatriates would be asked to stay.

The week-long celebrations in honor of Saba-Saba Day (7-7 Day i.e. July 7) the 13th anniversary of the founding of TANU dominated the non-Parliamentary news.

The texts of the first two speeches are now available and will be sent to the Department with comments as soon as possible; the latter pair was delivered in Swahili and will have to be translated before transmission. The 1967/1968 Budgets of all four speakers were approved but not without considerable; back-talk from the back benchers.

Said one; 'This Middle East affair has left many Tanzanians wondering where we really stand' vis à vis non-alignment and accused the Government of an 'automatic ' unthinking pro-Egyptian response to the situation. Said the other; the Israelis deserve to live? To any sensible man the answer should be 'yes.'' Both plainly accused Nasser of aggression. A third reader drew the lesson that it might not be too smart to challenge South Africa or Rhodesia; 'you start a war and then within a fortnight you find that they have eaten their way from Pretoria to Kampala and then you wonder!' During the week the Minister for Agriculture dropped a small bombshell in the Assembly when he told the Members that the Tanganyika National Transport Cooperative subject of controversy in the Assembly last year is now bank- rupt. A bill to set the National Bank of Commerce soundly on its feet with a capital of £5000000 ($14000 000) has been introduced into the Assembly by the Minister for Finance. The same Minister also plans to rename the National Cooperative 'National Bank for Rural Development is clearly intended to help quiet the constant Development criticisms of MP.'s from rural districts who insist the Government is not doing enough for the folks down on the farms. Several M.P.'s including a Zanzibar septuagenarian have volunteered for National Service following the Second Vice-President's announcement of plans to extend this controversial program to take in adult Tanzanians. As the week drew to a close the streets of Dar es Salaam echoed to the hobnailed boots and the singing of National Servicemen marching in practice for Saba Saba Day (July 7). Curious palm leaf arches were erected on one road and promptly began to collapse. The Chinese pavilion at the Saba Saba festival Grounds is complete; we are told that inside it stands a 12-foot statue of the great leader great teacher and great helmsman himself. * 冰羊冰水冰 ***** ***** Minister BOMANI reported to the nation on June 23 and said that Tanzania's achievement in fulfilling its first Five Year Plan now half over 'is much better than the efforts of many other developing countries around the world.'

Tanzania only disapproved of the use of Israel as a catspaw by the imperialists--the U.S. and Britain--to trouble in the Middle East in order to protect their vested interests. This 'clarification' appeared in the newspapers June 1 but there was no indication of just how the imperialists had used Israel as a catspaw and just how the U.S. and Britain came to the conclusion that the current Middle East crisis could possibly serve to protect their interests. President Nyerere did little to clear up these points in a June 1 statement before the TANU National Executive meeting in Iringa. stated flatly that Tanzania recognized Israel's 'claim to existence' but went on to say that peace could only be maintained through Israel's recognition of the right of the Palestine refugees to go home through a refusal by Israel to join in 'imperialist adventures' to get rid of Nasser cessation of the imperialists' exploitation of 'natural up trouble for their own ends. sympathy' for Israel to whap 'pressman' carried this theme to The Nationalist's ineffable extreme on June 2 when he commented that whatever the result of the current Mideast crisis the worst casualty would be US. diplomacy and President JOHNSON's prestige.

Nyerere closed by pointing out that Egypt did not try to force Syria to stay in the U.A.R. but today the two countries are 'standing side by side ready to defend each other.' Tanzania's fence-straddling position with respect to Nigeria may be a reflection of its own problems and attitudes toward East African unity. President Nyerere made it plain however on June 3 that Tanzania was still firmly committed to the principle of East African co-operation. Speaking at the opening of a new East African Common Services Organization (EACSO) headquarters building in Dar es Salaam Nyerere said that East African unity was not dead. He pointed out that countries in other parts of the world had seen the need for unity. He added that although Tanzania regretted that federation had not been achieved would continue to work for the greatest degree of economic co-operation consistent with national sovereignty June 5 when principles and sentiments will be put to the test the meeting of the three East African Presidents opens in Kampala to complete the agreements for new East African regional institutions.
